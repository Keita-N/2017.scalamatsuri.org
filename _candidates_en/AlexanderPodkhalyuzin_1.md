Implicit conversions and parameters are fundamental and unique features of Scala that are powerful at the same time. To use these features to their maximum potential, and do so with confidence, you have to understand the specifics of how Scala compilerâ€™s implicits search works. I will cover this topic in details, including ways you can optimize the implicits search algorithm in your library. The second part will focus on IntelliJ IDEA and how to leverage your IDE for working with implicits. Among other helpful IDE features, I will show how to debug implicits in IntelliJ IDEA.
