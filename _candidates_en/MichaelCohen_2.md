Software Engineering is like Art (music / visual arts) in that they are the only two areas of human study that do not have a "correct way" of doing things, but in fact, do have "wrong ways" of doing things.  

There are many different roles within art as there are within software engineering - see the parallels between the two and understand where/how you fit in.

There is beauty in art, as there is beauty in software engineering - this talk delves into what makes art beautiful, and how software engineers can employ the same tactics to make their code beautiful.
