Although I'm a Java programmer, I think I've managed to figure out the typeclass in Haskell, and its Scala equivalent implicit parameters.
This is a primer on what a typeclass is, in my own words.
I hope we learn together, so those who can't tell the difference between typclass and the class in Java and Scala and those who are afraid of implicit parameters are absolutely welcome!
