Although I'm a Java programmer, I believe I've managed to figure out the typeclass in Haskell, and its Scala equivalent implicit parameters.
This session will be a primer on what a typeclass is, through my own understanding.
I hope that we can all learn together, so whether you can't tell the difference between typeclass and the class in Java and Scala or are afraid of implicit parameters, you are absolutely welcome to attend!
