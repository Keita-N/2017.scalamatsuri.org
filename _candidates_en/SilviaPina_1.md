Beauty is a combination of pleasing traits, and is not exclusive to art, as it applies to disciplines like mathematics. Debates about beauty / code elegance may be implicit but are at the heart of many concerns of modern software development, and contribute positively to quality metrics. Functional programming, coupled with Category Theory, can represent a plethora of well-defined patterns used to cut through the boilerplate and emphasize the purpose of code. We will explore how we use functional programming to achieve beauty in code, and how that translates to high quality software projects.
