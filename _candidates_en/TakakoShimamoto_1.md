There are always horrible code in any languages.
I have witnessed the reality of destruction horrible code brings, even when they are written by accident.

In Scala, it's relatively simple to write asynchronous processing, but you might overlook the bigger picture happening on the frameworks (such as Play and Slick).
In this session, I will illustrate seemingly elegant code that turns out to bring a total destruction.

Note: The purpose is to learn from the mistake to avoid repeating it.
