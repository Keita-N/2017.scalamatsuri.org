There is always horrible code in any language.
I have witnessed the reality of the destruction that horrible code brings; even when it was written by accident.

In Scala, it's relatively simple to write asynchronous processing, but you might overlook the bigger picture happening on the frameworks (such as Play and Slick).
In this session, I will illustrate seemingly elegant code that turns out to bring about total destruction.

Note: The purpose of this session is to learn from mistakes to avoid repeating them.
