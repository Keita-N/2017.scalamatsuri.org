There's an increasing demand for stream data processing, which processes ever-ocurring data in the real-time, visualizes the result, or handles the resulting event. In this session, we will see the some of the aspects of stream data processing, how they tackle the issues of batch processing, and it newly enables. Just in this few years there have been a number of stream data processing platforms such as Spark Streaming, Flink, Apex, Gearpump, and Beam, so much so that it's unclear from the user's perspective where we are headed. By illustrating the history of stream data processing on the JVM, along with the comparison of products that came out in this few year, I hope to clarify the key points around the platforms that the developers should know when building a stream data processing system.
