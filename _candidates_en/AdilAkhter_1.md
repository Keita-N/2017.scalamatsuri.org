In this talk, you will get a practical overview of various functional structures that allows building powerful, highly-composable and purely-functional abstractions. The primary goal of this session is to dive into these structures and gain insight on applying them in solving computational problems.

Hence, from scratch, we will learn how to build the abstractions such as Monoids,  Functors, Applicatives, Monads and so on. Alongside, from the practical point of view, we will discover the essence of these structures in encoding purely functional programs that are correct-by-construction.
