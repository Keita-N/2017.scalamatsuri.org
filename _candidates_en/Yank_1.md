Scala kept me away for a long time because I've held a "prejudice" that it's a difficult language.

Meanwhile, I've ran into a language called Kotlin, spent a few days learning the basic syntax, and grown to be active in their community -- giving talks, writing blog post.

When I returned to Scala recently, I felt like the distance between me and Scala has shortened considerably. I was able to comprehend the basic syntax much smoother than before. I'm stil a greenhorn, but I've become proficient enough to whip out hobby apps in Scala.

In this session, I'd like to discuss the possibility of learning Scala after learning Kotlin, and some of the pitfalls around it.
