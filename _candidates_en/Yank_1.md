I stayed away from Scala for a long time because I've held a "prejudice" that it was a difficult language.

During this time, I've discovered a language called Kotlin, spent a few days learning the basic syntax, and have grown to be active in their community -- giving talks, writing blog posts, etc.

I've recently returned to Scala, and I feel that the gap between me and Scala has closed considerably. I am now able to comprehend the basic syntax much more smoothly than before. I'm still a greenhorn, but I've become proficient enough to whip out hobby apps in Scala.

In this session, I'd like to discuss the pros and cons of learning Scala after learning Kotlin.
