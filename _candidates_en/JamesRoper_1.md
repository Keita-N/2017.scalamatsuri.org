There are plenty of reactive technologies out there, but these are only the building blocks for building reactive systems, using these technologies to build a system does not necessarily make the system reactive. A reactive system will have a fundamentally different architecture to the traditional monolith found in the enterprise.

This presentation will look at how Lagom and Scala can be used to rearchitect the flow of data through a monolith to replace it with microservices.
