It's been two years since we've announced the migration of our product from PHP to Scala.
We've received mixed reviews during this period, but at the end of 2016 we will finally be launching the product that adopted Scala, named Falcon.
We've given the code name Falcon after the unmanned spacecraft Hayabusa (that landed on the asteroid Itokawa and returned samples in 2010).
Like the actual Hayabusa, we faced many walls of challenges, and the whole team came together to overcome each of them.
The history of failures and successes was also a discovery process to find new values.
As such, some of the technical components and architecture has evolved over time.

In this session Katou, who's been involved with the project since its early days, will share the meandering product stories, and the transitions of the architecture.
