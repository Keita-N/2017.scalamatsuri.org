Scala Warrior is a game designed to help users learn Scala. The game is played by using Scala code input from the user to move a samurai and fight. It is inspired by Ruby Warrior. You can learn Scala while playing it. In this session, I will discuss the reasoning behind the development of Scala Warrior, how to use Scala.js (which in used to implement Scala Warrior), and type-safe web development using Scala.js.
