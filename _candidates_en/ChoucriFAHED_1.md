Elm is a simple and fun language for writing rich and robust web applications. Elm generates performant JavaScript, with the promise of no runtime errors. In this presentation, I will briefly introduce the language, it's architecture, then show why it makes sense to use it with Scala. Thus oppose it to Scala.js, and demo a Play web application through the sbt-elm plugin.
