This talk is going to walk you through the development of a simple game using Scala Native from the bare basics. It will cover a number of topics, starting from the initial project setup, explain how to interoperate with native code and ultimately get your game running.

No prior knowledge of Scala Native is required. Beginner-level familiarity with C is recommended.
