Our mobile game development team has adopted Scala and Play for the server side.
The server development for mobile games is required to offer features with complicated logics to massive amount of players, and maintain high-throughput, low bug, and robust system constantly.

In this session, we would like to share some of the tips and tricks we've gained from the currently operating titles and the titles that are underway.
We will cover API server stories such as deployment and turing, as well as our original ideas for game servers such as encription and caching.
