As the requirements for web frontend development become more sophisticated day by day, the functional reactive programming (or, FRP) paradigm is attracting a great deal of attention.
FRP, in short, is a paradigm for asynchrnonous data flow programming; and it has been applied to solve difficult programming challenges that arise the field of robotics and graphical user interfaces (GUI).
There has been several programming languages specifically for FRP, but Elm is especially noteworthy.
Elm is one of the JavaScript alternatives (AltJS), and it's able to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from a single source file.
Being Haskell-based, Elm is equipped with strong static typing. Furthermore, it is a framework that provides an architecture for creating for creating web apps.
In this presentation, I will introduce the functional reactive language Elm to Scala programmers.
