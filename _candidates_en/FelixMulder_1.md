The new Scala compiler is nearing beta readiness. A lot of thought has gone into designing Dotty to be as fast and structurally sound as possible. Now comes the next step - adding a new level of usability to the compiler and the surrounding tools.

In this talk I want to show what Dotty can offer you as a developer in terms of improved experience - whether it is awesome error messages, rewrite rules or optimizations.

I will also talk about how we are optimizing the project for outside contributors, and what you can do to get involved today!
