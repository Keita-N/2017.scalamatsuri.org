Scala is a powerful language. With its flexible and expressive syntax - concise yet not terse - even a single line of Scala can leverage an impressive amount of JVM power. It is the static language that feels dynamic.

In this fun and engaging interactive talk (entirely live from the Scala REPL), I present dozens of Scala snippets that show us how to get dynamic productivity in a statically typed language.

It is not about short or overly clever code. It's about writing clear and elegant code.

Don't forget to bring your REPL!
