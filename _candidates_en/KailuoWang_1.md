Cats provides some type classes and data types that enable combining functions that we usually have to combine manually. Shapeless can help us deal with heterogeneous typed function arguments without boilerplate. Built on top of them, kittens and henkan are two small libraries as experiments of combining generic and functional programming. Through some examples using these libraries, this talk will provide a peek at the power of datatype generic functional programming - how we can flexibly combine functions with effects and different data presentation types without compromising safety.
