With Java 8 adoption skyrocketing, is Scala still relevant? In our opinion, the answer is an unequivocal yes. To make our point, Tomer Gabel (system architect at Wix) will showcase practical examples where Scala's features provide a definitive advantage over Java 8. We'll cover:

* Effective logging with traits and by-name parameters;
* Pattern matching for fun and profit;
* Type-safe, efficient serialization with type classes.
