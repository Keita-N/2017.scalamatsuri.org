The current tech lead of the sbt development team Eugene (@eed3si9n) will review:

- the sbt 0.13.x series that's been under development as technology preview since 2014
- the sbt server feature which is planned to be shipped with the next major sbt release
- and the rest of sbt 1.0

Hopefully, by the time ScalaMatsuri is held we can report some good progress.
