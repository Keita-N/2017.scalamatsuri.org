Cocolable is in the business of cross-border e-commerce, providing Amazon and eBay market for Japanese suppliers.
Related to the service, we generate reports using an Amazon API (Marketplace Web Service, or MWS) and eBay API.
Since Java was the common language that was officially supported by both markets, we've chosen Scala for the development.
In this session, we will share the challenges that we faced during the development.
