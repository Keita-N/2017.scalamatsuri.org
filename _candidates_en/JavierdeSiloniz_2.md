In 47 Degrees, the company I work for, we've embraced the creation of architectures based on Free Monads in order to totally decouple business logic and actual implementation in a pure functional way. During this talk I'll share our experience while facing this new kind of design, from the theory behind to the development cycle and final deployment to the servers, focusing in two of our open-source projects: Scala-Exercises and the backend of 9Cards. All this in order to show that FREE is not some kind of dark sorcery but just an awesome new way to develop your server (or frontend) apps.
