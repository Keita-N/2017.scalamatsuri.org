After the construction of several datalakes and large business intelligence pipelines, we now know that the use of Scala and its principles were essential to the success of those large undertakings.


In this talk, we will go through the 7 key scala-based architectures and methodologies that were used in real-life projects. More specifically, we will see the impact of these recipes on Spark performances, and how it enabled the rapid growth of those projects.
