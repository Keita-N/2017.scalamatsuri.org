A short talk describing how to painlessly use OpenCV from Scala and how to connect it with Akka Stream. Using the data we accumulate, we can train a Spark Support Vector Machine to classify smiling and non-smiling faces. Finally, using that trained classifier, we can build an app that can identify smiling and non-smiling faces in a video stream.
