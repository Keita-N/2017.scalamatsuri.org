Typelevel programming is a technique that can be used for compile-time calculations, code generation, and static analysis.
Because Scala's type system is Turing complete, and therefore it can accomplish any arbitrary algorithms, many engineers are familiar with it as a dark art.

In this session, we will introduce a compiler that can convert normal (non-typelevel) programs into typelevel meta program in Scala, the fundamental technology behind it, and explore the charm of typelevel programming.
