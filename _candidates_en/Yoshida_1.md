ScalikeJDBC is a powerful and flexible database access library. In conjunction with Skinny ORM, it provides better handling of databases. I'll share my experience of using these in production for a year. I've found that SQL provides more direct access to databases, whereas the CRUD API provides an easier to use wrapper around the database.
