You might be familiar with the following situations.
"I want to do something X, but what libarary in Scala should I use?"
"I know of a library Y, but how can I use it?"

In this session, we will introduce the libraries we used to build an actual internal API.
The purpose of the session is to share the knowledge around what features we used, what we liked, and when to use it.
I hope this session can reduce the barrier around Scala adoption, and help to promote in various cases.

Examples: sbt, Finagle, scrooge, Specs2, ScalaCheck, ScalaMock, scalafmt, scalaz
