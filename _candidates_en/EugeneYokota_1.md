As sbt 1.0 development is underway, Eugene is going to share some of the rigging
he's been bringing to the development.
We'll first take a detour and look into the history of JSON libraries in Scala.
Next, we'll explore what we can learn from companies, such as Google, that have been developing
cloud-native microservices to develop robust APIs
that can evolve over time.
