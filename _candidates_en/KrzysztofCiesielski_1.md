Apache Kafka is now widely adopted among modern distributed systems. In this presentation we will see how Akka Streams can add even more power to Kafka by exposing it as a reactive stream. We will see some examples of how the Reactive Kafka library can be leveraged to build a well-fitting and elegant match of partitioned, pull-based distributed log and asynchronous, backpressured streaming model.
