It seems like all the dust about microservices has finally settled. We know how to design, develop and operate them. Although most of the microservices are stateless - they delegate things like persistence and consistency to a database. But sometimes you benefit when you keep the state inside the application.

In this presentation I’m going to talk about why you want to build stateful microservices and design choices you make. I’ll explain tools like Akka Clustering and Akka Persistence in depth and show a few practical examples.
