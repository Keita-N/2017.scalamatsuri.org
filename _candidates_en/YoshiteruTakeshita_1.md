This talk will pull back the curtain on the development know-how of Geisha Tokyo Entertainment, a pioneer in Scala game development. Here at Geisha Tokyo, we use Scala in various phases of development from high-load service development, to prototyping, middleware development, voice actor selection, patching, and tooling. We'll see not only the technical aspects of them, but we'll also get into the back stories behind their development, how we reinforced the Scala talents, and how Scala helps us run the business today.
